# Opioid Deaths Over the Years

by Natalie Lu

I gathered this data from [a CORGIS dataset](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/opioids/) about deaths from opioid overdoses in the U.S. It goes into detail about aspects like death rates from certain opioids, death rates among racial groups, and death rates among sexes.

TODO: Put visualization here

The visualization above shows the rate of overdose deaths across all opioid drugs, taking in deaths from drugs such as heroin, cocaine, prescription, and synthetic opioids. It separates it into death rates among females and males. It appears that over the years, the rate of overdose deaths has increased, but the death rate among female users has historically been higher than that of males.
